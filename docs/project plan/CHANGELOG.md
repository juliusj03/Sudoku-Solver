# Changelog

Please document any changes you make to your project plan after getting approval from course staff.

12-12-2023:
Requirements in the project plan were updated after receiving feedback. Requirements conerning the hints were
made less vague and the generator feature was lowered in priority.

09-01-2024
Removed the following two requirements:
- The program must clearly provide the cell that can be filled in (according to the ‘last remaining cell’ principle) if they press the ‘hint’ button twice
- If the ‘last remaining cell’ algorithm  cannot find a cell to fill in, a cell from the solution is revealed instead.

Since it is an edge case that the algorithm cannot find a cell to fill in. So it is better to focus our efforts elsewhere. This is the case for both the points above.

Furthermore, the development methodology section of the project plan was updated to the rules and tools that are currently applied to the project. We changed from using Notion for our SCRUM methodology to just using GitLab issues, since it everyone was more familiar with this and thus made it easier.

'Uploaded sudoku is automatically processed on sudoku validity' user story has changed from a should have to a could have since this feature is not really necessary for the project, while it also works by just pressing the various buttons present in the UI.

'Allow users to get hints when making a sudoku' user story has changed from a should have to a must have. Since offering hints to the user with different algorithms is more important than thought at first.
